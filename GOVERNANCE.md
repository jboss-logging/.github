# Simple Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for **JBoss Logging**. This governance model is designed to uphold the principles
of transparency, open collaboration, and community involvement.

## Roles and Responsibilities

* **Contributors:** Anyone who contributes to JBoss Logging in any form.
* **Maintainers:** Contributors eligible for write access to a JBoss Logging code repository.
  * Responsible for driving initiatives and reviewing/merging contributions in their area of expertise.
* **Project Lead:** Maintainer with higher decision power.
  * Responsible for keeping JBoss Logging's technical direction consistent, safe and sustainable. This involves in
    particular enforcing compliance with requirements of the Commonhaus Foundation.

## Decision-Making

### Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus)

JBoss Logging primarily aims for a consensus-based decision-making process, where Maintainers and active Contributors discuss
and come to an agreement.

In practice, this involves:

* Discussing matters openly, to facilitate others joining the discussions and expressing concerns.
* Taking into account every Contributor's opinion, regardless of their role.

> [!NOTE]
> Actual implementation of consensus decision-making is up to Maintainers and can vary based on the audience and
> criticality of the discussion. Inspiration may be found in
> the [Lazy Consensus model as defined by the Apache Foundation](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html),
> and in [Martha's Rules](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1825&context=sociologyfacpub).

## Conflict Resolution

If conflicts arise, Maintainers are responsible for facilitating a resolution.

1. The **Project Lead** holds the power to make the final decision.
2. As a last resort, in particular in case of disagreement about the decision-making process, the **Commonhaus
   Foundation Council (CFC)** can be asked to mediate the discussion.

## Role Granting/Revoking

The role of Maintainer or Project Lead is granted or revoked through the decision-making process,
with additional restrictions:

1. The discussion must happen in a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/jboss-logging/discussions).
2. The opinion of the Maintainer or Project Lead whose role is being discussed does not factor into the decision.
3. Discussions regarding the role of Project Lead must last at least 30 days.

### Eligible candidates:

* **For the role of Maintainer:** Any contributor.
* **For the role of Project Lead:** Any contributor.

Maintainers and Project Leads keep their role indefinitely, unless they resign or a new decision revokes their role.
