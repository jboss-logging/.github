# JBoss Logging

Welcome to the JBoss Logging organization! We maintain a suite of logging projects that provide flexible, performant logging solutions for Java applications.

## Core Projects

### [JBoss Logging](https://github.com/jboss-logging/jboss-logging)
A logging facade that can bind to different log managers, allowing applications to be log manager agnostic. Supports JBoss Log Manager, Log4j 2, SLF4J/Logback, and Java Util Logging.

### [JBoss LogManager](https://github.com/jboss-logging/jboss-logmanager)
A powerful log manager implementation with advanced features and high performance.

### [JBoss Logging Tools](https://github.com/jboss-logging/jboss-logging-tools)
Annotation processor for generating typed loggers and internationalized messages at build time.

## Integration Projects

We provide integration libraries for popular logging frameworks:

- **[slf4j-jboss-logmanager](https://github.com/jboss-logging/slf4j-jboss-logmanager)** - SLF4J backend for JBoss LogManager
- **[slf4j-jboss-logging](https://github.com/jboss-logging/slf4j-jboss-logging)** - SLF4J backend for JBoss Logging
- **[log4j2-jboss-logmanager](https://github.com/jboss-logging/log4j2-jboss-logmanager)** - Log4j 2 API implementation for JBoss LogManager
- **[commons-logging-jboss-logging](https://github.com/jboss-logging/commons-logging-jboss-logging)** - Apache Commons Logging replacement
